      <p>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks.
        n ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed
        to keep it trading close to its net asset value.Most ETFs track an index, such as a stock index or bond index.
       ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features.<br>
