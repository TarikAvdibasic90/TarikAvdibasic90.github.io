        <h3>Basic information about the ETFs!</h3>
        <ol>

          <ul><li><h5>1.What is an ETF?</h5></li></ul>
  				<p>	An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that involves a collection of securities
         such as stocks—that often tracks an underlying index, although they can invest in any number
         of industry sectors or use various strategies. ETFs are in many ways similar to mutual
         funds; however, they are listed on exchanges and ETF shares trade throughout the day just
         like ordinary stock.<br>
         KEY TAKEAWAYS:<br>
         - An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock.<br>
     - ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds that only trade once a day after the market closes.<br>
     - ETFs can contain all types of investments including stocks, commodities, or bonds; some offer U.S. only holdings, while others are international.<br>
     - ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions than buying the stocks individually.</p>

     <ul><li><h5>2.Types of ETFs!</h5></li></ul>
  				<p>There are various types of ETFs available to investors that can be used for
            income generation, speculation, price increases, and to hedge or partly offset
            risk in an investor's portfolio. Below are several examples of the types of ETFs.<br>
            - Bond ETFs might include government bonds, corporate bonds, and state and local
                bonds—called municipal bonds.<br>
              - Industry ETFs track a particular industry such as technology, banking, or the oil
                 and gas sector.<br>
              - Commodity ETFs invest in commodities including crude oil or gold.<br>
              - Currency ETFs invest in foreign currencies such as the Euro or Canadian dollar.<br>
              - Inverse ETFs attempt to earn gains from stock declines by shorting stocks. Shorting is selling a stock,
                 expecting a decline in value, and repurchasing it at a lower price.</p>




                 <ul><li><h5>3.How to buy and sell ETFs?</h5></li></ul>
  				<p>	ETFs trade through online brokers and traditional broker-dealers. You can view some of the
          top brokers in the industry for ETFs with Investopedia's list of the best brokers for ETFs.
          An alternative to standard brokers are robo-advisors like Betterment and Wealthfront
          who make use of ETFs in their investment products.</p>

          <ul><li><h5>4.Advantages and Disadvantages of ETFs!</h5></li></ul>
  					   <p>ETFs provide lower average costs since it would be expensive for an investor to
                buy all the stocks held in an ETF portfolio individually. Investors only need to
                execute one transaction to buy and one transaction to sell, which leads to fewer
                broker commissions since there are only a few trades being done by investors.
                Brokers typically charge a commission for each trade. Some brokers even offer
                no-commission trading on certain low-cost ETFs reducing costs for investors even
                further.<br>
                An ETF's expense ratio is the cost to operate and manage the fund. ETFs typically
                have low expenses since they track an index. For example, if an ETF tracks the
                S&P 500 index, it might contain all 500 stocks from the S&P making it a
                passively-managed fund and less time-intensive. However, not all ETFs track an
                index in a passive manner.</p><br><br>
