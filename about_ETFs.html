        <h1>Basic Information about the ETFs!</h1><br>
        <h5>1.What is an ETF?</h5>
        <p>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that involves a collection of securities
         such as stocks—that often tracks an underlying index, although they can invest in any number
         of industry sectors or use various strategies. ETFs are in many ways similar to mutual
         funds; however, they are listed on exchanges and ETF shares trade throughout the day just
         like ordinary stock.

         <h6>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h6>
         <p>- An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock.<br>
           - ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds that only trade once a day after the market closes.<br>
           - ETFs can contain all types of investments including stocks, commodities, or bonds; some offer U.S. only holdings, while others are international.<br>
           - ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions than buying the stocks individually.</p>
