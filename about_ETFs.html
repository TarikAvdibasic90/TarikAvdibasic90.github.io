        <h1>Basic Information about the ETFs!</h1><br>
        <h5>1.What is an ETF?</h5>
        <p>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that involves a collection of securities
         such as stocks—that often tracks an underlying index, although they can invest in any number
         of industry sectors or use various strategies. ETFs are in many ways similar to mutual
         funds; however, they are listed on exchanges and ETF shares trade throughout the day just
         like ordinary stock.
         </p>
         <h6>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h6>
         <p>- An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock.</p>
          <p> - ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds that only trade once a day after the market closes.</p>
          <p> - ETFs can contain all types of investments including stocks, commodities, or bonds; some offer U.S. only holdings, while others are international.</p>
         <p>- ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions than buying the stocks individually.</p>

          <h5>2.Types of ETFs</h5>
          <p>There are various types of ETFs available to investors that can be used for
            income generation, speculation, price increases, and to hedge or partly offset
            risk in an investor's portfolio. Below are several examples of the types of ETFs.</p>
            <p>- Bond ETFs might include government bonds, corporate bonds, and state and local
              bonds—called municipal bonds.</p>
            <p>- Industry ETFs track a particular industry such as technology, banking, or the oil
               and gas sector.</p>
            <p>- Commodity ETFs invest in commodities including crude oil or gold.</p>
            <p>- Currency ETFs invest in foreign currencies such as the Euro or Canadian dollar.</p>
            <p>- Inverse ETFs attempt to earn gains from stock declines by shorting stocks. Shorting is selling a stock, expecting a decline in value, and repurchasing it at a lower price.
